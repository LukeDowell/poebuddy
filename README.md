# PoeBuddy

The goal of this project is to create a web application that can accurately
provide players with the best way to craft any given item in PoE. 

The definition of "best" is variable. For some it might mean "fastest", and for
others it might mean "cheapest". The application should be able to take this into
account and provide several solutions to a given crafting problem.
